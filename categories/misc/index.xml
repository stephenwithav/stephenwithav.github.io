<p>Hi there!  I&#39;m Steven and this is where I ramble a bit about myself.</p>
<p>
Go caught my interest when I noticed its native Unicode support in <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.1#unicode">Go 1.1</a>, as I had dreams of creating a TUI <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Number_Munchers_1990">Number Munchers</a>-like clone to help learn Japanese.  (Hiragana and Katakana were easy, but I never solved the problem of how to handle Kanji and their many readings.)</p>
<p>
Prior to Go, I transitioned to <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> for both personal projects and to hopefully solve the factoring problem for any large <em>N</em> into <em>pq</em> in <em>O(log N)</em> time.  I still believe it&#39;s possible despite my many failed attempts.</p>
<p>
Finally, I was briefly the CTO of a startup called VidTec, I contributed to <a href="https://www.wired.com/author/steven-edwards/">Wired News</a>, and I once managed the largest spinal cord injury forum in the world for a few years.</p>
